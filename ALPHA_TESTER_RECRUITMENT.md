## What is Contest Log Analytics?

Contest Log Analytics (CLA) is a **post-mortem analysis engine** for amateur radio contesting—think of it as "game tape" for radiosport. Most logging software is designed for the heat of battle. **CLA is designed for the day after**, when you want to understand:

- Who owned the band at 0200Z?
- Which multipliers did you miss that your competitors found?
- Exactly how your operating strategy differed from the winner's approach?
- Where you gained or lost your advantage in the margins?

**Public Log Archive Integration**: Direct access to CQ WW archives—fetch competitor logs instantly without manual downloads
