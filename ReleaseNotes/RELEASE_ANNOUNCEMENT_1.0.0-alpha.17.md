## Highlights

This release adds a **Report List** (pull-out drawer) on the main, QSO, and multiplier dashboards. A chevron on the left edge (vertically centered) opens a sidebar listing all generated reports in the same hierarchy as the ZIP download. Click any report to open it in the full-screen overlay. The list uses actual filenames (callsign/band when present); JSON is excluded; undefined reports appear under Miscellaneous. Search, category collapse, and active-report highlight are included.

## What's New

### Report Manifest Drawer
- **Pull-out arrow** on the left, halfway down the viewport, opens a report list sidebar.
- **Hierarchical list** matches the ZIP structure: Single Log Reports, Comparison Reports, Multiplier Reports, QSO / Contest-wide, Miscellaneous, Bulk Actions.
- **Filename labels** so band and callsign are visible when present (e.g. `qso_rate_plots_20m--k3lr_w3lpl`).
- **One-click open** in the existing full-screen report overlay; drawer closes after selection.
- **Search** to filter the list; **collapse/expand** categories; **Escape or scrim** to close. "Download All (.zip)" in the drawer focuses the main Download All button.
