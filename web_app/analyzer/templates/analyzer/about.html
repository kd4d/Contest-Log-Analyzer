                        Professional sports teams don't just play the game; they watch the "game tape" afterwards to understand <em>why</em> a play failed or succeeded.
                        Most logging software is designed for the heat of battle—getting the QSO in the log efficiently.
                        <strong>Contest Log Analytics</strong> is designed for the day after.

                        By analyzing your logs against your competitors, this tool uncovers the hidden story of the contest: 
                        who owned the band at 0200Z, who found the multipliers you missed, and exactly how your operating strategy differed from the winner's.

                                "Common" QSOs are the price of admission—everyone works them.
                                Contests are won in the margins. Our reports isolate "Unique Run" and "Unique S&P" QSOs to show exactly 
                                where you gained (or lost) your advantage relative to the competition.
