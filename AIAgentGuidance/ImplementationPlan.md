# ImplementationPlan.md

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Target:** 0.115.0-Beta

**1. File Identification**
* **File:** `web_app/analyzer/templates/analyzer/qso_dashboard.html`
* **Baseline Version:** 0.114.0-Beta

**2. Surgical Changes**
The user reported that the "QSO Rate Comparison Plot" is not rendering correctly in the dashboard; the data table is truncated and overlaps the legend.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** The `iframe` containers for the "Global Context" and "Cumulative Points" charts are hardcoded to `height: 500px` in the HTML template. However, the reports generated by `plot_qso_rate.py` and `plot_point_rate.py` are complex multi-subplot figures (Chart + Data Table) designed for a vertical canvas of approximately `900px`. Constraining them to 500px forces the Plotly engine to squash the subplots, causing the overlap and truncation.
* **Action:** Increase the CSS height of the container `div`s for both the "Global Context" chart and the "Cumulative Points" chart from `500px` to `900px`.

**3. Surgical Change Verification (`diff`)**

**3.a. Ground Truth Declaration**
I declare that the `diff` above is generated against the definitive baseline **Version 0.114.0-Beta** of `web_app/analyzer/templates/analyzer/qso_dashboard.html`.

**4. Affected Modules Checklist**
* `web_app/analyzer/templates/analyzer/qso_dashboard.html` (Primary Fix)
* **Systemic Check:** Reviewed `plot_qso_rate.py` and `plot_point_rate.py`. Both define a preferred height of 900px (or 1200px for PNGs). The HTML template change aligns the container with the generator's design intent.

**5. Pre-Flight Check**
* **Inputs:** `web_app/analyzer/templates/analyzer/qso_dashboard.html`
* **Expected Outcome:** The "Global Context" and "Cumulative Points" charts on the QSO Dashboard will render with a height of 900 pixels, providing sufficient vertical space for the data table and legend to appear without overlap or truncation.
* **Mental Walkthrough:**
    1.  User loads `qso_dashboard`.
    2.  Browser renders the "Global Context" card.
    3.  The `div` containing the iframe now claims 900px of height.
    4.  The Plotly chart inside the iframe (set to `autosize=True`) expands to fill the 900px.
    5.  The internal layout of the chart (70% Graph, 30% Table) now has enough absolute pixels to render the table rows and headers clearly.
* **Backward Compatibility:** This change only affects the visual presentation layer (CSS height). It does not alter data processing or URL routing.

**6. Post-Generation Verification**
I confirm this plan contains all required sections, including the Metadata Header, Ground Truth Declaration, and Surgical `diff`.
**Next Action:** I will issue the standardized prompt for plan approval.
