# ImplementationPlan.md

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Target:** 0.134.1-Beta

## 1. File Identification
* **File:** `contest_tools/reports/text_missed_multipliers.py`
* **Baseline Version:** 0.134.0-Beta

## 2. Surgical Changes
The `missed_multipliers` report contains a logic error in the table generation loop. The `main_table.add_row(row)` statement is currently dedented outside the loop that iterates through the missed multipliers. This results in only the final multiplier being added to the table, instead of a row for every multiplier.

1.  **Indentation Correction**: Move the `main_table.add_row(row)` call inside the `for mult` loop scope to ensure every processed multiplier row is added to the report table.

## 3. Surgical Change Verification (`diff`)
**Ground Truth Declaration:** This `diff` is generated against `contest_tools/reports/text_missed_multipliers.py` version **0.134.0-Beta**.

## 4. Affected Modules Checklist
* `contest_tools/reports/text_missed_multipliers.py`: Primary modification.

## 5. Pre-Flight Check
* **Inputs:** `output_path`, `mult_name`.
* **Expected Outcome:** The text report generated by this module will now list *all* missed multipliers in the main table, not just the last one processed.
* **Mental Walkthrough:**
    1.  The code iterates `for mult in aggregated_data['missed_mults_on_band']:`.
    2.  It constructs the display name and iterates through callsigns to build the `row` list.
    3.  **Correction:** The `main_table.add_row(row)` is now executed immediately after the inner `for call` loop finishes, while still inside the `for mult` loop.
    4.  The loop repeats for the next multiplier.
* **Backward Compatibility:** Fixes a regression; restores expected behavior.
* **Syntax Validation:** Python indentation is critical; diff confirms 4-space indent shift.
