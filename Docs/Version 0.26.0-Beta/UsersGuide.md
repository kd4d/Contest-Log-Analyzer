## 1. Introduction: What is the Contest Log Analyzer?

The Contest Log Analyzer is a powerful command-line tool designed for amateur radio contesters who want to perform deep, data-driven analysis of their operating performance. It goes beyond the simple score summary provided by most logging software, allowing you to:

* Process raw Cabrillo log files into a clean, standardized format.
* Automatically classify every QSO as "Run," "Search & Pounce," or "Unknown" to analyze your operating strategy.
* Generate detailed reports and charts that compare your log against one or more others.
* Analyze performance on a band-by-band basis to identify strengths and weaknesses.
* Calculate contest-specific QSO points for supported contests.

The ultimate goal of this program is to help you understand your contest operation in minute detail, identify missed opportunities, and improve your strategy for the next event.

## 2. What You Need to Get Started

Before running the analyzer, you will need a few files:

* **Your Cabrillo Log File(s)**: These are the standard log files generated by your contest logging software (e.g., `k3lr.log`, `kc1xx.log`). You can analyze a single log or compare multiple logs at once.
* **Data Files**: The program requires specific data files to be placed in a central `data/` directory.
    * `cty.dat`: Required for all contests.
    * `ARRLDXmults.dat`: Required for the ARRL DX contest.
    * `SweepstakesSections.dat`: Required for ARRL Sweepstakes.
* **An Environment Variable**: You must tell the program where to find your data files by setting an environment variable named `CONTEST_DATA_DIR`. This variable should point to your `data` directory.
