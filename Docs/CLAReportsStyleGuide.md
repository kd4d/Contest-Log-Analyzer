## 1. Introduction
This document is the single source of truth for the visual and formatting standards of all report outputs generated by the Contest Log Analyzer. Its purpose is to ensure that all reports, regardless of type, have a consistent, clean, and professional appearance. All new reports must adhere to these guidelines.

---
## 2. Report Titles
All generated reports, regardless of their output format (text, plot, chart, or HTML), must use the standard three-line title format. This creates a consistent and professional header for all user-facing documents.

* **Line 1**: The report's official `report_name`.
* **Line 2**: The contest context, formatted as `Year EventID ContestName`.
* **Line 3**: The callsigns being analyzed (e.g., `K1ABC` or `K1ABC vs W1XYZ`).

---
## 3. Text Reports (`.txt`)
This section defines the standards for all plain-text reports.

### 3.1. Table Formatting
All new text-based tables must be generated using the **`tabulate`** Python library. This ensures that all tables have clean, perfectly aligned, fixed-width columns.
* **Required Format**: The standard format to be used is **`tablefmt='psql'`**.

---
## 4. HTML Reports (`.html`)
This section defines the standards for all web-based reports. The goal is to create modern, responsive, and visually appealing documents.

### 4.1. Styling Framework
All styling for HTML reports must be implemented using **Tailwind CSS**. No custom CSS in `<style>` blocks should be used unless absolutely necessary for a feature that Tailwind cannot support.

### 4.2. Table Styling
HTML tables should be styled to be clean, readable, and visually hierarchical.
* **Centering**: All tables must be centered horizontally on the page.
* **Border Hierarchy**: A two-level border system must be used to structure the data visually:
    * **Dark Lines** (`border-gray-500`): Used for the main outline of the table and for major vertical divisions between logical data groups.
    * **Medium Lines** (`border-gray-400`): Used for all internal grid lines, both horizontal and vertical.
