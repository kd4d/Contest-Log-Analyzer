# AI Agent Rules for Git Operations

This document provides specific rules for AI agents (like Cursor/Console AI) when performing git operations on this repository.

---

## Overview

**Primary Principle:** AI assists with git operations, but the user maintains final control over critical operations.

---

## What AI Can Do Directly

### ✅ Commit Message Generation
- Generate Angular-formatted commit messages
- Suggest appropriate commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Format commit messages with proper structure

### ✅ Feature Branch Commits
- Create commits on feature branches
- Use informal messages during development ("wip", "refactor X")
- Commit code changes directly to feature branches

### ✅ Generate Commands
- Suggest git commands for workflows
- Generate merge commands with `--no-ff` flag
- Create command sequences for complex operations

### ✅ Automatic Operations
- Pre-commit hooks automatically update `version.py` git hash
- No manual intervention needed for hash updates

---

## What Requires User Review/Approval

### ⚠️ Merges to Main Branch
**Process:**
1. AI generates merge command: `git merge --no-ff feat/branch-name`
2. AI generates merge commit message in Angular format
3. **User reviews** merge message in editor
4. **User saves/closes** editor to complete merge
5. **User pushes** when ready

**Why:** Main branch is sacred - requires human oversight

### ⚠️ Creating Tags/Releases
**Process:**
1. AI suggests version number based on commit types
2. AI suggests update to `version.py`
3. **User confirms** version number
4. AI generates commands:
   ```bash
   # Update version.py __version__ to match tag
   # Commit version change
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.5
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta.5
   ```
5. **User reviews** and executes commands
6. **User confirms** tag creation

**Why:** Releases are critical - require explicit approval

### ⚠️ Pushing to Remote
**Process:**
1. AI suggests push commands
2. **User executes** push commands manually
3. AI should NOT auto-push without explicit user request

**Why:** Security control - prevents accidental remote changes

### ⚠️ Hotfix Operations
**Process:**
1. AI generates hotfix workflow commands
2. **User reviews** each step
3. **User executes** step by step
4. User confirms each critical operation (tag, push)

**Why:** Hotfixes are high-risk - require careful manual review

## Commit Message Standards

### For Feature Branch Commits
- Can use informal messages: `"wip: adding widget framework"`
- Can use shorthand: `"refactor dashboard"`, `"fix bug"`
- Focus on development context, not user-facing changes

### For Merge Commits to Main
- **Must follow Angular format strictly:**
  ```
  feat(dashboard): add user dashboard with widgets

  Implements main dashboard view with widget framework.
  Adds real-time data updates and user preferences.
  
  - Created dashboard view component
  - Implemented widget system
  - Added API integration for live data
  ```
- **Subject:** User-facing feature description
- **Body:** What the feature does (not implementation details)
- **Format:** Lowercase, imperative, < 50 chars for subject

### For Direct Commits to Main (Rare)
- Follow Angular format strictly
- Use appropriate type (fix, docs, chore)
- Include detailed body for significant changes

---

## Version Management

### How Version.py Works
- `contest_tools/version.py` contains `__version__` and `__git_hash__`
- Pre-commit hook automatically updates `__git_hash__` before each commit
- `__version__` should match most recent git tag (manual update before releases)

### Before Creating a Tag
1. **User specifies** target version (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta.5`)
2. **AI suggests** updating `version.py`:
   ```python
   __version__ = "1.0.0-beta.5"
   ```
3. **User confirms** version number
4. **AI generates** commit message:
   ```
   chore: bump version to 1.0.0-beta.5
   ```
5. **User commits** version change
6. **User creates** tag: `git tag v1.0.0-beta.5`
7. **User pushes** tag: `git push origin v1.0.0-beta.5`

### Untagged Commits
- Version string will be: `"1.0.0-beta.5-3-gabc1234"` (most recent tag + distance + hash)
- Git hash always included: `"1.0.0-beta.5 (commit abc1234)"`
- This works for bug reports - version + hash = exact code state

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development
```
User: "Commit these changes with a message about adding the dashboard"

AI:
1. Generates commit message following Angular format
2. Shows: "feat(dashboard): add user dashboard with widgets
   
   Implements main dashboard view with widget framework."
3. Executes: git commit -m "..."
4. Confirms: "Committed to feat/dashboard branch"
```

### Example 2: Merge to Main
```
User: "Merge feat/dashboard into main"

AI:
1. Generates: git checkout main && git pull
2. Generates: git merge --no-ff feat/dashboard
3. Opens editor with merge message:
   "feat(dashboard): add user dashboard with widgets
   
   Implements main dashboard view with widget framework."
4. Waits for user to review/edit and save
5. Confirms: "Merge complete. Ready to push?"
6. User: "Push it"
7. AI suggests: git push origin main
8. User executes manually
```

### Example 3: Creating a Release Tag
```
User: "Tag the next beta release"

AI:
1. Checks recent commits for version bump
2. Suggests: "Based on recent commits, suggest v1.0.0-beta.5"
3. User: "Yes"
4. AI updates version.py __version__ = "1.0.0-beta.5"
5. AI generates: git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0-beta.5"
6. AI suggests commands:
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.5
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta.5
7. User reviews and executes
```

## Error Handling

### If Pre-commit Hook Fails
- AI should explain the error
- Do NOT skip hooks without user permission
- Fix the issue (e.g., update version.py manually) before proceeding

### If Merge Conflicts
- AI should detect conflicts
- AI should suggest resolution steps
- **User must resolve** conflicts manually
- AI can help review conflict resolution

### If Version Mismatch
- AI should warn if `version.py` doesn't match recent tag
- AI should suggest updating version before tagging
- User must confirm version number

---

## Safety Checks

Before any critical operation, AI should:
1. ✅ Confirm current branch (`git branch`)
2. ✅ Show recent commits (`git log --oneline -5`)
3. ✅ Warn if on main branch for direct commits
4. ✅ Suggest creating feature branch if not on one
5. ✅ Verify pre-commit hooks are installed

---

## Summary

**AI's Role:** Generate, suggest, assist, format
**User's Role:** Review, approve, execute, control
**Balance:** AI efficiency + Human oversight = Safe, consistent workflow
