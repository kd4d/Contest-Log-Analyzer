## 1. Introduction

[cite_start]This guide explains how to read and interpret the various reports generated by the Contest Log Analyzer. [cite: 2168] [cite_start]The goal is not just to understand the numbers, but to turn them into actionable insights that can help you improve your scores in future contests. [cite: 2169]
---

## 2. Text Reports

[cite_start]Text reports provide detailed, granular data in a plain-text format. [cite: 2172] [cite_start]They are best for deep-dive analysis and finding specific details. [cite: 2172]

### Score Report (`score_report`)

[cite_start]This is a comprehensive, single-log summary of your final score, broken down by band. [cite: 2173] [cite_start]It provides the most important top-level metrics for your operation. [cite: 2174]

#### How to Interpret This Report

* [cite_start]**AVG (Average Points per QSO)**: This is a crucial metric. [cite: 2175] [cite_start]An AVG close to 3.0 indicates a strong focus on high-value inter-continental QSOs. [cite: 2176] [cite_start]An AVG closer to 1.0 or 2.0 suggests more contacts within your own continent. [cite: 2177]
* [cite_start]**Multiplier Totals**: For contests like CQ WW, multipliers are counted on each band. [cite: 2178] [cite_start]The `TOTAL` row shows the *sum* of multipliers from each band, not the number of unique multipliers. [cite: 2179]
---

### QSO Summary (`summary`)

[cite_start]This report provides a high-level comparative overview of the total QSO counts and operating styles for all analyzed logs. [cite: 2180]

#### How to Interpret This Report

[cite_start]This report is the quickest way to understand fundamental differences in operating strategy. [cite: 2181] [cite_start]A station with a high Run-to-S&P ratio is primarily calling CQ, while a station with a lower ratio is spending more time tuning the bands. [cite: 2182]
---

### Rate Sheet (`rate_sheet` & `rate_sheet_comparison`)

[cite_start]The `rate_sheet` provides an hour-by-hour breakdown of QSO rates for a single log, while the `rate_sheet_comparison` places this data side-by-side for multiple logs. [cite: 2183]

#### How to Interpret This Report

[cite_start]Use this report to analyze strategic differences in band selection and pacing. [cite: 2184] [cite_start]You can see which operator was on which band during critical times (like band openings) and how their hourly rates compare. [cite: 2185]
---

### QSO Comparison Summary (`qso_comparison`)

[cite_start]This powerful pairwise report breaks down how two logs compare on each band, focusing on which QSOs were **unique** to each station and which were **common** to both. [cite: 2186]

#### How to Interpret This Report

[cite_start]The **Unique** columns reveal the real strategy. [cite: 2187] [cite_start]If one operator has a high number of "Unique Run" QSOs, it means their CQing was effective at attracting stations the other operator never logged. [cite: 2188, 2189] [cite_start]A high number of "Unique S&P" QSOs would indicate that one operator was more effective at searching for and finding rare stations that the other missed. [cite: 2190] [cite_start]This analysis is key to understanding *how* an advantage was gainedâ€”whether through a more effective "Run" frequency or superior "S&P" skill. [cite: 2191]
---

### Missed Multipliers (`missed_multipliers`)

[cite_start]This report is essential for identifying the most costly unworked stations. [cite: 2192] [cite_start]It lists every multiplier that was worked by at least one person in the group but missed by at least one other, showing who worked it and how. [cite: 2193]

#### How to Interpret This Report

[cite_start]The text `(Run)`, `(S&P)`, or `(Both)` shows how the station logged that multiplier. [cite: 2194] This is critical information. [cite_start]If your competitor worked a rare multiplier via `(S&P)`, it means they found it by tuning the band. [cite: 2195] [cite_start]If they got it via `(Run)`, it means that multiplier *called them*. [cite: 2196]
---

## 3. Plots and Charts

[cite_start]Plots and charts provide a high-level, visual summary of performance. [cite: 2197]

### QSO Rate Plot (`qso_rate_plots`)

[cite_start]This plot shows the cumulative QSO total over the course of the contest. [cite: 2198] [cite_start]It's the best way to visualize the overall "horse race." [cite: 2199]

#### How to Interpret This Plot

* [cite_start]**Slope of the Line**: A steeper slope indicates a higher QSO rate. [cite: 2200] [cite_start]You can see periods where one station pulls ahead or another catches up. [cite: 2201]
* [cite_start]**Plateaus**: Flat sections of the graph indicate off-times or periods of very low activity. [cite: 2202]
* [cite_start]**Inset Table**: The table provides a convenient summary of the final QSO totals and the Run/S&P/Unknown breakdown for each station. [cite: 2203]
---

### Cumulative Difference Plot (`cumulative_difference_plots`)

[cite_start]This plot presents rate information as a cumulative difference, which shows trends and momentum shifts more clearly than traditional rate graphs. [cite: 2204] [cite_start]It is one of the most powerful analysis tools in the package for visualizing the flow of a competition between two logs. [cite: 2205]

#### How to Interpret This Plot

This plot shows a comparison of two logs (e.g., Station A minus Station B).
* **Top Panel (Overall Diff)**: This shows the total QSO difference. [cite_start]When the line is above zero, Station A is ahead. [cite: 2207] When it drops below zero, Station B has taken the lead. [cite_start]The slope reveals who is winning at any given time. [cite: 2208]
* [cite_start]**Middle Panel (Run Diff)**: This isolates the difference in **Run** QSOs. [cite: 2209] [cite_start]It shows which operator had a more effective run station over time. [cite: 2210]
* [cite_start]**Bottom Panel (S&P+Unk Diff)**: This isolates the difference in **S&P** QSOs. [cite: 2211] [cite_start]An upward trend shows that Station A was more effective at Search & Pounce. [cite: 2212]
* [cite_start]**Strategic Insight**: This plot tells a clear story about how the contest was won or lost, breaking down whether the advantage came from running or S&P. [cite: 2213]
---

### QSO Breakdown Chart (`qso_breakdown_chart`)

[cite_start]This chart provides a visual companion to the `qso_comparison` text report, breaking down the unique and common QSOs on each band. [cite: 2214]

#### How to Interpret This Chart

[cite_start]This chart is unique to this analyzer and reveals where each station gained its advantage. [cite: 2215]
* [cite_start]**Gray Bar (Common)**: This represents the base of QSOs that both stations worked. [cite: 2216]
* [cite_start]**Colored Bars (Unique)**: The stacked, colored bars on either side show the QSOs that were unique to that station, broken down by Run, S&P, and Unknown. [cite: 2217]
* [cite_start]**Strategic Insight**: On 20 meters, for example, a high "Common" bar shows both stations worked a similar pool of stations. [cite: 2218] [cite_start]However, large red segments (**Unique Run** QSOs) would reinforce that they were successfully running different sets of stations. [cite: 2219]
---

### Point Contribution Breakdown (`chart_point_contribution`)

[cite_start]This chart shows where your points came from. [cite: 2220] [cite_start]For CQ WW, for example, points are awarded based on the continent of the station worked. [cite: 2221]

#### How to Interpret This Chart

* [cite_start]**Pie Chart**: The slices show the proportion of total points that came from each point value. [cite: 2222] [cite_start]In CQ WW, 3-point inter-continental QSOs are the most valuable. [cite: 2223]
* [cite_start]**Table**: The table below the chart provides the exact counts for each point category and the final average points per QSO. [cite: 2224]
