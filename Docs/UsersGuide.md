## 1. Introduction: What is the Contest Log Analyzer?
[cite_start][cite: 1940, 2184][cite_start]The Contest Log Analyzer is a powerful command-line tool designed for amateur radio contesters who want to perform deep, data-driven analysis of their operating performance. [cite: 2184] [cite_start][cite: 824, 1940][cite_start]It goes beyond the simple score summary provided by most logging software, allowing you to: [cite: 825, 1940, 2185]

[cite_start]* [cite: 826, 1941, 2186][cite_start]Process raw Cabrillo log files into a clean, standardized format. [cite: 2186]
[cite_start]* [cite: 827, 1941, 2187][cite_start]Automatically classify every QSO as "Run," "Search & Pounce," or "Unknown" to analyze your operating strategy. [cite: 2187]
[cite_start]* [cite: 828, 1941, 2188][cite_start]Generate detailed reports and charts that compare your log against one or more others. [cite: 2188]
[cite_start]* [cite: 829, 1941, 2189][cite_start]Analyze performance on a band-by-band basis to identify strengths and weaknesses. [cite: 2189]
[cite_start]* [cite: 830, 1941, 2190][cite_start]Calculate contest-specific QSO points for supported contests. [cite: 2190]
[cite_start][cite: 830, 1941, 2190][cite_start]The ultimate goal of this program is to help you understand your contest operation in minute detail, identify missed opportunities, and improve your strategy for the next event. [cite: 2190]

## 2. What You Need to Get Started

Before running the analyzer, you will need a few files:

[cite_start]* [cite: 831, 1942, 2191][cite_start]**Your Cabrillo Log File(s)**: These are the standard log files generated by your contest logging software (e.g., `kd4d.log`, `n0ni.log`). [cite: 2191] [cite_start][cite: 832, 1942, 2192][cite_start]You can analyze a single log or compare multiple logs at once. [cite: 2192]
[cite_start]* [cite: 833, 1942, 2193][cite_start]**Data Files**: The program requires specific data files to be placed in a central `data/` directory. [cite: 2193]
    [cite_start]* [cite: 834, 1942, 2194][cite_start]`cty.dat`: Required for all contests. [cite: 2194]
    [cite_start]* [cite: 835, 1942, 2195][cite_start]`arrl_10_mults.dat`: Required for the ARRL 10 Meter contest. [cite: 2195]
    [cite_start]* [cite: 836, 1942, 2196][cite_start]`ARRLDXmults.dat`: Required for the ARRL DX contest. [cite: 2196]
    [cite_start]* [cite: 837, 1942, 2197][cite_start]`NAQPmults.dat`: Required for NAQP and CQ 160-Meter contests. [cite: 2197]
    * [cite_start]`SweepstakesSections.dat`: Required for ARRL Sweepstakes and ARRL Field Day. [cite: 1917, 2198]
    * `band_allocations.dat`: Required for all contests to perform frequency validation.
[cite_start]* [cite: 839, 1942, 2199][cite_start]**An Environment Variable**: You must tell the program where to find your data files by setting an environment variable named `CONTEST_LOGS_REPORTS`. [cite: 2199] [cite_start][cite: 840, 1942, 2200][cite_start]This variable should point to the root directory that contains your `Logs`, `data`, and `reports` subdirectories. [cite: 2200]

## 3. How to Run the Analyzer

[cite_start][cite: 841, 1942, 2201][cite_start]The program is run from your command prompt or terminal using `main_cli.py`. [cite: 2201]
#### **Basic Syntax**

    python main_cli.py --report <ReportID|all|chart|text|plot|animation> <LogFile1> [<LogFile2>...] [options]

#### **Command-Line Options**

[cite_start]* [cite: 842, 1942, 2202][cite_start]`--report <ReportID|all|chart|text|plot|animation>`: (Required) Specifies which report to generate. [cite: 2202] [cite_start][cite: 843, 1942, 2203][cite_start]Use a specific `ReportID` (e.g., `score_report`), `all` to generate every available report, or a category keyword like `chart` to run all chart reports. [cite: 2203]
[cite_start]* [cite: 844, 1942, 2204][cite_start]`<LogFile1> ...`: (Required) One or more paths to the Cabrillo log files you want to analyze. [cite: 2204]
* `--verbose`: (Optional) Enables detailed `INFO`-level status messages for debugging.
[cite_start]* [cite: 845, 1942, 2205][cite_start]`--include-dupes`: (Optional) By default, duplicate QSOs are ignored. [cite: 2205] [cite_start][cite: 846, 1942, 2206][cite_start]Use this flag to include them in all calculations. [cite: 2206]
[cite_start]* [cite: 847, 1942, 2207][cite_start]`--mult-name <name>`: (Optional) For reports that analyze multipliers (like `missed_multipliers`), this specifies which multiplier to use (e.g., 'Countries', 'Zones'). [cite: 2207]
[cite_start]* [cite: 848, 1942, 2208][cite_start]`--metric <qsos|points>`: (Optional) For the `cumulative_difference_plots` report, this specifies whether to compare QSO counts or Point totals. [cite: 2208] Defaults to 'qsos'.
[cite_start]* [cite: 849, 1942, 2209][cite_start]`--debug-data`: (Optional) When used with a visual report (chart, plot, animation), this saves the report's source data to a `.txt` file in a `Debug/` subdirectory. [cite: 2209]
* [cite_start]`--debug-mults`: (Optional) Save intermediate multiplier lists from text reports for debugging. [cite: 2172, 2210]
#### **Examples**

* **Generate all available reports for two logs:**

__CODE_BLOCK__
python main_cli.py --report all 2025/cq-160-cw/kd4d.log 2025/cq-160-cw/n0ni.log
__CODE_BLOCK__

* **Generate only the text reports for two logs:**

__CODE_BLOCK__
python main_cli.py --report text 2025/cq-160-cw/kd4d.log 2025/cq-160-cw/n0ni.log
__CODE_BLOCK__

* **Generate a specific report (Score Summary) for a single log:**

__CODE_BLOCK__
python main_cli.py --report score_report 2025/cq-160-cw/kd4d.log
__CODE_BLOCK__

* **Generate a Missed Multipliers report for CQ WW Zones:**

__CODE_BLOCK__
python main_cli.py --report missed_multipliers --mult-name Zones Logs/2024/cq-ww-cw/k3lr.log Logs/2024/cq-ww-cw/kc1xx.log
__CODE_BLOCK__

## 4. Supported Contests

[cite_start][cite: 850, 1942, 2211][cite_start]The analyzer uses the `CONTEST:` field in your Cabrillo file header to automatically apply the correct rules. [cite: 2211] The following contests are currently supported:

* ARRL 10 Meter
* ARRL DX (CW & SSB)
* [cite_start]ARRL Field Day [cite: 2172]
* ARRL Sweepstakes (CW & SSB)
* CQ 160-Meter (CW & SSB)
