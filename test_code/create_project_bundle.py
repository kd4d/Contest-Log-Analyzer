# Contest Log Analyzer/test_code/create_project_bundle.py
#
# Purpose: This utility traverses a directory to find all relevant project
#          files and consolidates them into a single text file. By default,
#          it bundles source code (.py, .json), but can be switched to
#          bundle documentation files (.md, .txt) via a command-line flag.
