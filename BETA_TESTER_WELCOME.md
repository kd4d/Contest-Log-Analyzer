## What is Contest Log Analytics?

Contest Log Analytics is a **post-mortem analysis engine** for amateur radio contesting—think of it as "game tape" for radiosport. While most logging software is designed for the heat of battle, **CLA is designed for the day after**, when you want to understand:

- Who owned the band at 0200Z?
- Which multipliers did you miss that your competitors found?
- Exactly how your operating strategy differed from the winner's approach?
- Where you gained or lost your advantage in the margins?

## Important: Alpha Testing Phase

**This is a fast-moving alpha project under active development.** You will encounter bugs, edge cases, and incomplete features. Performance may vary. Some calculations may need verification. **If you're looking for a polished, production-ready tool, this is not it yet.**

We're looking for testers who understand alpha software and are willing to work through issues while providing constructive feedback.
